it's WYSIWYG, where u can turn your designs to native apps with a single click.       

# Basic Idea
-   draw ur app. using scratch like interface
-   compile ur app
    -   select a backend to use, a backend is reponsible running ur app
    -   example of a backend: using python with pygame so when u compile u will get a identical app written in python
